# Like Feature Setup Instructions

## ðŸŽ‰ Like Feature Added Successfully!

I've added a complete like feature for images where users can like images and see the like count.

### What's Been Added:

1. **Database Table**: `image_likes` table to store likes
2. **Like Button Component**: Reusable component with heart icon and count
3. **Gallery Page**: Like buttons on all images
4. **Homepage Gallery**: Like buttons on gallery preview
5. **User Authentication**: Only logged-in users can like images

### Setup Required:

**Step 1: Run the SQL Script**

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: add-likes-feature.sql
```

This will create:

- `image_likes` table
- RLS policies for security
- Helper functions for like counts

### Features:

âœ… **Like/Unlike Images**: Users can click heart to like/unlike
âœ… **Like Count Display**: Shows number of likes for each image
âœ… **User Authentication**: Only logged-in users can like
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Like count updates immediately
âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Heart fills when liked, shows count
âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

### How It Works:

1. **User clicks heart** â†’ Like/unlike the image
2. **Count updates** â†’ Shows current number of likes
3. **Visual feedback** â†’ Heart fills when liked
4. **Authentication** â†’ Only logged-in users can like

### Files Modified:

- `src/components/LikeButton.tsx` - New like button component
- `src/app/gallery/page.tsx` - Added like functionality
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added like functionality to homepage
- `add-likes-feature.sql` - Database setup script

### Next Steps:

1. Run the SQL script in Supabase
2. Test the like functionality
3. Users can now like images and see counts!

The like feature is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
